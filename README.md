This is a plugin (script) for BitBar for macOS, showing IP address info and Andrews & Arnold broadband quota.

You need to have BitBar (https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/releases/latest) installed for this to work.

If you are not an Andrews & Arnold customer, the IP address bits of the script will still work.
